# System-Rebuild-Application-Deployment
Upon arriving to the primary site in the school district (8:30AM), myself and the network engineer meet with the technical coordinator for both school locations. From there, we plug in and power on all windows devices (desktops & laptops), plug them into chargers, and ensure that they do not shut down for at least 5 hours. Inform all staff to not shut down their devices. 
All three of us drive over to the other district location to perform the same set of actions. Our System Administrator informs us that the  RMM tool suite is ready for mass deployment; it will just require a collective reboot across both locations. Tech lead and myself coordinate noon as the designated time to make an annoucement for both schools. 
The announcement is made and the reboot is planned for noon; Unfortunately, the teachers were geared for early dismissal at 11 am so not all machines were rebooted. 
The next task us for myelf to tally the machines that were rebooted and contain the RMM tool suite (Atera and Bitdefender) at the primary location; tech lead does the same at secondary location; device names/types/serial #s are logged and entered into a multi-worksheet excel file. 
The Excel file is put in a shared drive for the new MSP's System Administrator to see; from here, he compares the sheet that was sent to him to another sheet has has on hand (and uploads to a shared drive) of the devices that are not showing up in his RMM portal.
